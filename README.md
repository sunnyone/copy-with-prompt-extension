# Copy With Prompt

This VS Code extension allows you to enter a prompt in a dedicated text area and quickly copy it together with the current content of the editor. It’s particularly useful when you need to include a custom prompt along with the text in your editor for sharing, logging, or pasting into other applications.

## Features

- **Prompt Input Field**: Type your desired prompt directly into the extension’s text area.  
- **One-Click Copy**: Click the copy button or execute the copy command to copy both your custom prompt and the active editor’s content.  

## Usage

1. **Open the Extension**: Launch “Copy With Prompt” from the VS Code sidebar or the Command Palette.
2. **Enter a Prompt**: Type your prompt into the extension’s input field.
3. **Select the Active Editor**: Make sure you have the file open (and active) in the editor whose content you want to copy.
4. **Copy**: Click the copy button or use the copy command. The extension will automatically copy the prompt along with the editor’s content.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.96.0 or later is recommended.

## Extension Settings

Currently, this extension does not provide any configurable settings. Future updates may introduce additional customization options.

## Known Issues
